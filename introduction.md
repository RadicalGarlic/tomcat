# Introduction
Apache Tomcat is an open source web application server.

It implements Jakarta Servlet, Jakarta Server Pages, Jakarta Expression Language, Jakarta WebSocket, Jakarta Annotations and Jakarta Authentication specifications. These specifications are part of the Jakarta EE (enterprise edition) platform.

In Tomcat terminology, the current webapp is referred to as the "context".

Tomcat is typically installed as a daemon/service of a system, although it can also be run as a standalone process.
