Personal notes on Apache Tomcat.

Loosely based on the official documentation. A copy is [linked here](official-documentation/apache-tomcat-10.0.10-fulldocs.tar.gz).

Apache Tomcat is an implementation of the servlet specification, so it's recommended to read the notes on servlets before reading these.
